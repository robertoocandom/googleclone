# Google Clone
Google Search Clone


This project is part of the Platzi HTML and CSS course, from the Front-End Architect's career, the objective was to replicate
the Google Search Start Page, using different concepts of both HTML and CSS.

To carry out this project in HTML, use the tags respecting the grammatical elements of the BEM methodology.

We continue to advance in issues of CSS and HTML management. ;)
